<h2><a name="overview">League Overview:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>We compete in a 10-team league consisting of 2 divisions.</li>
  <li>Games are played head-to-head against a different opponent each week resulting in a win, loss, or tie based on the posted scoring system.</li>
  <li>The regular season is weeks 1-13, the postseason is weeks 14-16.</li>
  <li>The regular season schedule is the same every year, based on draft position. It includes one game against each team and a second against division foes.</li>
  <li>Each team has a maximum of a 16-man roster</li>
  <li>Starting Lineup: 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 D/ST</li>
  <li>Bench: any combination of positions for these 7 roster spots</li>
  <li>Starting line-ups lock 5 minutes prior to kickoff of each starter's NFL game. Once that player's game kicks off, he will be locked in as 'Starter' or 'Bench' by the website.</li>
  <li>In the event of a tie, the tiebreaker is the single highest-scoring player on each team's bench. These points do not count towards the score, but the team with the highest scoring bench player gets the win. If both teams' top bench players tie, the result is a tie.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="draft">Draft:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The draft will be held as close to the season's start as possible. You must be present and paid to participate in the draft.</li>
  <li>Draft order is posted on the site. Order is reversed for all even numbered rounds (a "snake draft"), except the 2nd round.</li>
  <li>All draft picks must be used, and all teams must draft a full starting team.</li>
  <li>The first 2 rounds of the draft are designated as "Keeper Rounds". This is further explained in <a href="#nextseason">the Next Season section</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="feespayouts">Fees & Payouts:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Entry fee - $50, due before the preseason draft</li>
  <li>Transaction fees (regular season)- $3 per player "added", due ASAP when your team is eliminated from postseason play.</li>
  <li>The cumulative league entry and transaction fees will be split into 20 payouts (5% each) as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1 for making the playoffs (there will be 6 teams)
    <li>1/2 for winning your division (2)</li>
    <li>1/2 for each: best record, points & power ranking champ (3)</li>
    <li>2 for making the Super Bowl (2)</li>
    <li>6-1/2 for winning the Super Bowl</li>
    <li>1 for winning the Toilet Bowl</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="nextseason">Next Season:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>We are a Keeper League</li>
  <li>Each team is allowed to keep up to 2 players from their year-end roster</li>
  <li>Draft order is determined by reverse-order of last year's standings with the following exceptions: the winner of the Toilet Bowl is awarded the #1 pick slot; the Super Bowl winner will pick 10th, and the SB loser will pick 9th.</li>
  <li>The first 2 rounds of the draft is designated as "Keeper Rounds", and will NOT SNAKE. If a team chooses to keep 1 player, they will forefeit their 1st round pick. If a team keeps 2 players, they forefeit both their 1st & 2nd round picks.</li>
  <li>Round 3 begins the regular draft, with the #1 draft position picking first. Round 4 is the first to "snake", with all even # rounds running in reverse-draft-order.</li>
  <li>Although we are keeping players, trading of Next Year's Draft Picks will NOT BE ALLOWED. However, offseason trades are allowed as follows: any player traded during the offseason is designated as a Keeper for the team who is giving the player up.</li>
  <li>If any owner is unable to return the following year, the new owner will take over the preexisting franchise, its roster, and its draft slot.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="transactions">Transactions:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Transactions (add/drop's) may be made at any time, from the time your roster is posted to the site until the start of the first game in the last week of the regular season (week 13). However, any add/drop's requested after kickoff of the week's first game until midnight Tuesday is subject to waivers.</li>
  <li>Trades are allowed, and are subject to a 2 day veto process. This essentially means that no trades are allowed on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. It takes 6 objections to veto a trade. The trade deadline is 1 hour before kickoff of week 11.</li>
  <li>Lazy-Ass Fee/Illegal Lineup/Roster Fee - $9 is charged to any owner who starts a player during their bye week, or when a player is listed on the injury report as "out".</li>
  <li>Waivers - Any add/drop's requested after kickoff of the week's first game until midnight Tue will be subject to waivers. Waivers will run (all at once) every Tue night between midnight and 6 a.m. Wed morning. Players will be awarded to teams in reverse-record order (with points as the tiebreaker). You can make as many waiver claims as you like, but once you are awarded one player, you are moved to the end of the line for the next player.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ir">Injured Reserve:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The site allows players to go on IR when they are on IR for their NFL team. This is beneficial for players you may want to keep next year.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="postseason">Postseason:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each team receives a league ranking, or cede, based on regular season record, from 1-10. The 'regular season champ' earns the #1 cede and the other division winner is #2. Cedes 1-6 will go on to the 'Super Bowl Playoffs'. Cede #'s 7-10 will enter the 'Toilet Bowl Tournament'.</li>
  <li>Week 14: SBP - #6 @ #3, #5 @ #4, #1 & #2 bye</li>
  <li>Week 15: SBP - lower cede of wk 14 winners @ #1 & hi cede @ #2; TB - #10 @ #7, #9 @ #8</li>
  <li>Week 16: Super Bowl - Wk 15 winners @ neutral site; Toilet Bowl - Wk 15 winners @ hi cede</li>
  <li>Home-field Advantage - The higher cede will be awarded a 3-point bonus in weeks 14 & 15. There is no bonus during week 16.</li>
  <li>Tiebreakers: 1 Head-to-head; (1a *For Division Champ Only* Division Record) 2 Points scored; 3 Power ranking; 4 Total points (including backups); 5 Points Against; 6 Points scored in final week; 7 Pts scored in previous wk, etc...</li>
  <li>Transaction fees (postseason)- $9 per player "added", due ASAP when your team is eliminated from postseason play. All fees collected for postseason transactions go to the Super Bowl winner.</li>
</ul>

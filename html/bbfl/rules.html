<h2><a name="overview">League Overview:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>We will be competing in a 10-team league consisting of 2 divisions.</li>
  <li>Games will be played head-to-head against a different opponent each week resulting in a win, loss, or tie based on the above scoring system.</li>
  <li>The regular season will be weeks 1-13, the postseason will be weeks 14-16.</li>
  <li>The regular season schedule has been generated. It includes one game against each team and a second against division foes. Your draft position determines your schedule.</li>
  <li>Each team will have a maximum of a 16-man roster</li>
  <li>Starting Lineup: 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 D/ST</li>
  <li>Bench: can be any combination of positions for these 7 roster spots</li>
  <li>Each starter must be denoted before 5 minutes prior to kickoff of his NFL game. Once that player's game kicks off, he will be locked in as 'Starter' or 'Bench' by the website.</li>
  <li>In the event of a tie, the tiebreaker will be the one highest-scoring player on each team's bench. These points will not count towards the score, but the team with the highest scoring bench player will get the win. If both teams' players tie, the result is a tie.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="draft">Draft:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The draft will be held on Sunday, August 31, at ? pm, at ??? You must be present and paid to participate in the draft... or maybe not?</li>
  <li>Draft order will be posted on the site (too lazy to update here).
  Order will be reversed for all even numbered rounds, resulting in a "snake draft".</li>
  <li>All draft picks must be used, and all teams must draft a full starting team.</li>
  <li>There is no set "time limit" to make a selection, but if you take too long, you will be heckled.</li>
  <li>06 The first 2 rounds of the draft will be designated as 'Keeper Rounds'. This is further explained in the 'Next Season' section below.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="feespayouts">Fees & Payouts:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Entry fee - $50 (+ $10 for expenses), due before the preseason draft</li>
  <li>Transaction fees - $3 per player 'added', due ASAP after your team is eliminated from the postseason play.</li>
  <li>The cumulative league entry and transaction fees will be split into 20 payouts (5% each) as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1 for making the playoffs (there will be 6 teams)
    <li>1/2 for winning your division (2)</li>
    <li>1/2 for each: best record, points & power ranking champ (3)</li>
    <li>1 for making the Super Bowl (2)</li>
    <li>8-1/2 for winning the Super Bowl</li>
    <li>1 for winning the Toilet Bowl</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="nextseason">Next Season:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>06 We are now (finally) a Keeper League</li>
  <li>Each team is allowed to designate up to 2 players from their year-end roster as 'Keepers'</li>
  <li>Draft order will be determined by reverse-order of last year's standings with the following exceptions: the winner of the Toilet Bowl will be awarded the #1 pick slot; the Super Bowl winner will pick 10th, and the SB loser will pick 9th.</li>
  <li>The first 2 rounds of the draft will be designated as 'Keeper Rounds', and will NOT SNAKE. If a team chooses to keep 1 player, they will forefeit their 1st round pick. If a team keeps 2 players, they forefeit both their 1st & 2nd round picks.</li>
  <li>Round 3 will begin the regular draft, with the #1 draft position picking first. Round 4 will be the first to 'snake', with all even # rounds running in reverse-draft-order.</li>
  <li>Although we are keeping players, trading of Next Year's Draft Picks will NOT BE ALLOWED. However, offseason trades are allowed as follows: any player traded during the offseason will be designated as a Keeper for the team who is giving the player up.</li>
  <li>If any owner is unable to return the following year, the new owner will take over the preexisting franchise, its roster, and its draft slot.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="transactions">Transactions:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Transactions (add/drop's) may be made at any time, from the time your roster is posted to the internet until the start of the first game in the last week of the regular season (week 13). However, any add/drop's requested after kickoff of the week's first game until midnight Tuesday will be subject to waivers.</li>
  <li>Trades will be allowed, and are subject to a 2 day veto process. This essentially means that no trades will be allowed on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. It takes 6 objections to veto a trade. The trade deadline is 1 hour before kickoff of week 11.</li>
  <li>Lazy-Ass Fee/Illegal Lineup/Roster Fee - $10 will be charged to any owner who starts a player during their bye week, or when a player is listed on the injury report as 'out'.</li>
  <li>07 Illegal Drop Fee - Any player picked up from the Free Agent Pool may not be dropped by that team during the same week, else they will be charged $10</li>
  <li>Waivers - Any add/drop's requested after kickoff of the week's first game until midnight Tue will be subject to waivers. Waivers will run (all at once) every Tue night between midnight and 6 a.m. Wed morning. Players will be awarded to teams in reverse-record order (with points as the tiebreaker). You can make as many waiver claims as you like, but once you are awarded one player, you will be moved to the end of the line for the next player.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="ir">Injured Reserve:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Players, when injured* (not suspended, i.e.) may be place on the IR. IR moves are treated the same as add/drop's, except that the injured player is not 'dropped', but is 'inactive'. The inactive player does not take up a roster spot, allowing a replacement player to be 'added'.</li>
  <li>The injured player must be reactivated ('added') when he is 'ready to play'*. Any player deemed 'ready to play' must be reactivated by kickoff of his teams game, or they will be released and subject to waivers, and your roster will be considered 'Illegal'.</li>
  <li>A player's status is determined by the NFL's weekly injury report, posted on Thursdays. 'Injured' is defined as "Doubtful" or worse. 'Ready to play' is "Probable" or better. If a player is not listed on the injury report, that means they are no longer injured.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="postseason">Postseason:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each team will receive a league ranking, or cede, based on regular season record, from 1-10. The 'regular season champ' earns the #1 cede and the other division winner is #2. Cedes 1-6 will go on to the 'Super Bowl Playoffs'. Cede #'s 7-10 will enter the 'Toilet Bowl Tournament'.</li>
  <li>Week 14: SBP - #6 @ #3, #5 @ #4, #1 & #2 bye; TB - #10 @ #7, #9 @ #8</li>
  <li>Week 15: SBP - lower cede of wk 14 winners @ #1 & hi cede @ #2; Toilet Bowl - Wk 14 winners @ hi cede</li>
  <li>Week 16: Super Bowl - Wk 15 winners @ neutral site</li>
  <li>Home-field Advantage - The higher cede will be awarded a 3-point bonus in weeks 14 & 15. There will be no bonus for week 16.</li>
  <li>Tiebreakers: 1 Head-to-head; (1a *For Division Champ Only* Division Record) 2 Points scored; 3 Power ranking; 4 Total points (including backups); 5 Points Against; 6 Points scored in final week; 7 Pts scored in previous wk, etc...</li>
  <li>IR transactions will be the only transactions allowed during the postseason, and will not cost any money.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="overview">League Overview:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>We compete in a 10-team league consisting of 2 divisions.</li>
  <li>Games are played head-to-head against a different opponent each week resulting in a win, loss, or tie based on the posted scoring system.</li>
  <li>The regular season is weeks 1-13, the postseason is weeks 14-16.</li>
  <li>The regular season schedule is set by the website.</li>
  <li>Each team has a maximum of a 16-man roster (not counting IR)</li>
  <li>Starting Lineup: 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 D/ST</li>
  <li>Bench: any combination of positions for these 7 roster spots</li>
  <li>The site locks players' starting status 5 minutes prior to kickoff of that player's NFL game.</li>
  <li>In the event of a tie, the tiebreaker is the single highest-scoring player on each team's bench
    <ul>
      <li>These points do not count towards the score</li>
      <li>If both teams' top bench players tie, the result is a tie</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="draft">Draft:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The draft is held as close to the season's start as possible.</li>
  <li>Draft order is posted on the site. Order is reversed for all even numbered rounds (a "snake draft"), except the 2nd round.</li>
  <li>All draft picks must be used, and all teams must draft a full starting team.</li>
  <li>The draft lasts 16 rounds:
    <ul>
      <li>The first 2 rounds of the draft are designated as "Keeper Rounds", and does NOT SNAKE.</li>
      <li>Round 3 begins the regular draft, with the #1 draft position picking first.</li>
      <li>Round 4 is the first to "snake", with all even # rounds running in reverse-draft-order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="feespayouts">Fees & Payouts:</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Entry fee - $50, due before the preseason draft</li>
